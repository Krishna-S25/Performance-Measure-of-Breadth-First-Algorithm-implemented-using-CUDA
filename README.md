# Performance-Measure-of-Breadth-First-Algorithm-implemented-using-CUDA
Parallel programming using OpenMP and CUDA


The aim of this project is to measure the performance of GPS navigation using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm implemented using the 
CUDA parallel computing platform. 
The BFS algorithm is one of the well-known graph traversal techniques that is widely used in various applications, including navigation systems. 
By implementing the algorithm using CUDA, we can accelerate execution speeds by utilizing the parallel processing capacity of contemporary GPUs.
